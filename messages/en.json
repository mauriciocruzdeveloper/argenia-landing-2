      "title": "Discover Apollo: Your Comprehensive Software Development Solution",
      "part1": "At ARGENIA, we are revolutionizing the way applications are developed with our flagship product: Apollo. This innovative system allows automatic creation of frontend and backend applications from a narrative, leveraging the power of Large Scale Language Models (LLMs) and advanced programmatic methods.",
      "part2": "Apollo takes a narrative provided by the user and, through a series of automated steps, converts that narrative into a fully functional application. The process begins with generating requirements from the entered narrative. Then, Apollo creates the necessary classes and definitions to build the backend with Strapi, one of the most flexible and scalable content management tools on the market.",
      "part3": "On the other hand, using the generated classes, Apollo also builds the user interface (UI), forms, and pages for a frontend application based on Next.js 14, the latest version of the popular React framework for high-performance web applications. This base app not only meets the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations but also provides a robust and customizable platform to implement more specific use cases according to the client's needs."

    "description2": {
      "title": "How Does Apollo Work?",
      "part1": "Apollo is a software development tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the creation of web and mobile applications. Its operation is based on code generation from a narrative provided by the user, allowing complete systems to be created in minutes.",
      "part2": "The development process with Apollo consists of the following steps:\n\nThe user enters a narrative or description of the application they want to create.\nApollo analyzes the narrative and extracts the key requirements and functionalities of the system.\nBased on the identified requirements, Apollo generates the necessary classes and definitions for the application's backend and frontend.\nThe backend is built using Strapi, a flexible and scalable content management tool.\nThe frontend is developed with Next.js 14, a React framework for high-performance web applications.\nThe end result is a fully functional application that meets the requirements specified by the user."

      "title": "State-of-the-Art Technologies Integrated",
      "part1": "Apollo not only facilitates development; it also incorporates a modern and powerful technology stack that ensures quality, scalability, and flexibility in every project. Some of the key components include:",
      "part2": "Next.js 14: A React framework that offers server-side rendering, automatic page optimization, and a robust architecture for modern web applications.",
      "part3": "Internationalization (i18n) with next-intl: Simplifies the creation of multilingual applications, allowing businesses to reach global audiences.",
      "part4": "Secure Authentication with next-auth: Provides a flexible and secure authentication system that supports multiple providers and authentication methods.",
      "part5": "Data Validation with Zod: Ensures that user-entered data meets the established requirements through efficient and secure validation schemas.",

      "title": "Benefits of Using Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Server-Side Data Fetching",
      "part1": "One of the key strategies that distinguishes Apollo is its use of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and server-side data fetching. This strategy brings multiple benefits:",
      "part2": "Improved Performance and SEO: By using SSR, pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the client's browser. This significantly improves page load time, providing a faster and smoother user experience. Additionally, server-side rendered pages are more search engine friendly, improving search engine optimization (SEO).",
      "part3": "Enhanced Security: With server-side data fetching, exposure of business logic and data manipulation on the client is minimized, reducing the risk of attacks and vulnerabilities.",
      "part4": "Real-Time Data Updates: Thanks to the ability to make API calls directly from the server, Apollo can provide real-time updated data, which is essential for applications that require fresh and accurate information.",
      "part5": "Reduction of Dependencies on Global State: By avoiding the use of Redux and handling state mainly on the server, Apollo simplifies application state management, reducing code complexity and improving maintainability."
    },
    "description5": {
      "title": "Benefits of Choosing Apollo",
      "part1": "Reduced Development Costs and Time: By automating the application generation process, Apollo significantly reduces the time required to go from conception to implementation. This not only lowers the costs associated with traditional software development but also allows companies to bring products to market faster.",
      "part2": "Flexibility and Scalability: Apollo provides a solid foundation that can be easily customized and extended to meet the specific needs of each client. Additionally, its integration with cutting-edge technologies ensures the system's scalability as business needs grow.",
      "part3": "Easy Maintenance: Thanks to the use of robust frameworks and automation, the applications generated by Apollo are easy to maintain and update, ensuring long-term continuity and efficiency.",
      "part4": "Improved User Experience: By using modern frontend technologies like Next.js and implementing server-side rendering, Apollo ensures that applications deliver a fast, smooth, and engaging experience for end users."
